Migrated from https://java.net/projects/yanfs/sources/svn/show

This project represents a Java implementation of the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4506.txt" rel="self">XDR</a>, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1831.txt" rel="self">RPC</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1094.txt"
rel="self">NFSv2</a>, and <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1831.txt"
rel="self">NFSv3</a> protocols in client side form.

WebNFS was the original name for this implementation but the name has changed to reflect the expanded scope of the project to include a server side implementation.
